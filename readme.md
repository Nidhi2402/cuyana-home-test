##Frontend Candidate Take Home Test
###Requirements
* Based on the [mockup found here](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/d978a109-bc33-482e-5840-9c737747c34d-af49/), generate a simple HTML page that includes a header, footer, hero image with text, and a content area.
* The content area should include a list of books based on data found in [books.json](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/0gqpl8tza87hbqs/AADFwvd3fIqhuJNtsvaNswPPa?dl=0&preview=books.json)

###Hints
* We'd like to see your UI/UX abilities - vanilla CSS/Javascript would be interesting
* However, don't shy away from using libraries if it makes sense - if you choose to utilize a library please list the reasons why you chose to use it
* The requirements are intentionally sparse - so the content area is your time to shine.  UI/UX, functionality, etc.

###Delivery
* Provide an archive (zip) or link to a public repo to david(at)cuyana.com
